# Energy-Monitor

A personal IoT project that collects single-phase energy data from a Shelly EM device, processes it using an AWS Lambda function, and forwards aggregated metrics to [Emoncms](https://emoncms.org/) and **DynamoDB** for visualization and storage.

---

## ðŸš€ Introduction

This repository demonstrates a complete end-to-end solution for monitoring energy consumption, production, and battery behavior in a home or small industrial setup:

1. A **Shelly EM** device gathers real-time current, voltage, power, and frequency data for the single phase.
2. A **mScript** script running on the device invokes a lightweight **AWS Lambda** endpoint at configurable intervals.
3. The Lambda function, written in **Python**, normalizes readings, computes key metrics (production, consumption, import/export, battery charging/discharging), and pushes data to **Emoncms** and **DynamoDB**.

## ðŸ”§ Architecture

1. **Shelly EM Script** (`scripts/shelly.js`) polls the device via `EM.GetStatus` and triggers `HTTP.GET` to the Lambda URL.
2. **AWS Lambda Function** (`lambda/Shelly_Script.py`) parses parameters, normalizes values, computes energy flows, and forwards payloads to Emoncms and DynamoDB.
3. **Emoncms** provides real-time dashboards.
4. **DynamoDB** stores time-series metrics for analytics.

## âœ… Features

- **Real-time polling**: Configurable interval (default 1 second) for high-resolution energy data capture.
- **Data normalization**: Zero-flattening and sign-handling for clean metrics.
- **Energy flow calculations**: Derived values for consumed, produced, imported, exported, and battery behavior.
- **Serverless ingestion**: AWS Lambda Function URL without API Gateway.
- **Dual outputs**: Pushes to Emoncms for visualization and to DynamoDB for persistent storage.
